# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-

This is my implementation for network intrusion detection system. 

SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier.

This classifier is basically trained by using wireshark data.

The libraries used in this classifier are numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib

The NIDS DATA contains a screenshot of the data.

The main point of this project is to train and tune a machine learning classifier.

It includes extracting and scaling the features and then training and tuning the ML classifier.
